# Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithms for Graph Coloring
Based on this paper, we can implement an algorithm to solve the Graph Coloring Problem.
First, we can enumerate an answer by dichotomy.
Then, we use the hybird algorithm to check the answer.
In this algorithm, we initialize a population and generate a offspring.
Then we can use tabu search to optimize it.

However, debugging this code is too hard for me. 
I hope you can help me.
